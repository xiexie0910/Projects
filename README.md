## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Alex Xie, a penultimate **Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)** student specialising in **Engineering Science** at The University of Auckland and I expect to complete my studies by the end of 2024.

👨‍💻 As a highly motivated and skilled university student with a strong interest in data science, I have a background in engineering and am proficient in programming languages such as Python, R, and C++. I am dedicated to using my technical skills to drive innovation and make a positive impact on the world. I have experience in data analysis, problem-solving, and communicating findings through presentations and reports. Eager to continue learning and growing as a data scientist, I am currently seeking any internship opportunities in New Zealand to develop and ultilize my skills to solve complex problems and drive business success.

🏀 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. Most of my hobbies are sports-related such as **Volleyball**, **Basketball** and a little bit of **Muay Thai**

📚 I also love reading books on **personal development** & **financial literacy**. My favorite ones are **Nonviolent Communication** by _Marshall Rosenberg_ in the genre of personal development and **The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness** by _Eric Jorgenson_ in the genre of financial literacy. I am currently reading **Rich Dad Poor Dad** by _Robert T. Kiyosaki_

💻 This repository consists of the projects that I have done outside of uni.
I am still at the early stages of building my porfolio, therefore, most of these projects are still at a beginner/intermediate level, but I will slowly build up the difficulty level and show off some more complex projects.
